# Hannah Banks
A basic SpringBoot application just messing around with RESTful API, MySQL, Hibernate, Lombok. Built with 
JDK Java17.

## Why did I do this?
Because Java is neat, and powerful. I wanted to have a playground built up where I can mess with other Java things.

Also:
- I wanted to supplement my Java knowledge
- I wanted to mess around with more MVC frameworks
- Data transfer objects are cool, this protects information (potentially) and facilitates communiciation between the API and the server
- The annotations provided by Lombok are interesting, I wanted to try some
- I've worked in projects that use gradle for build deps, I wanted to config with maven
- Usually I test endpoints with insomnia, I wanted to go back to Postman

### Wanna run and test this yourself?

1. Fork and clone
2. Set the project JDK to Java17
3. Run `HannahBankingAppApplication.main()` or run directly from your code editor UI
4. Test endpoints in Postman or Insomnia
